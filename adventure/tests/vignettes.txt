This file tests the behavior of the game in all sorts of specific
situations that would be very tedious to arrange in actual walkthroughs.
As the basis for these tests, we will start a game, enter the building,
and grab and activate the lamp.

>>> import adventure
>>> adventure.play(seed=3)
WELCOME TO ADVENTURE!!  WOULD YOU LIKE INSTRUCTIONS?
<BLANKLINE>
>>> no
YOU ARE STANDING AT THE END OF A ROAD BEFORE A SMALL BRICK BUILDING.
AROUND YOU IS A FOREST.  A SMALL STREAM FLOWS OUT OF THE BUILDING AND
DOWN A GULLY.
<BLANKLINE>
>>> brief
OKAY, FROM NOW ON I'LL ONLY DESCRIBE A PLACE IN FULL THE FIRST TIME
YOU COME TO IT.  TO GET THE FULL DESCRIPTION, SAY "LOOK".
<BLANKLINE>
>>> enter
YOU ARE INSIDE A BUILDING, A WELL HOUSE FOR A LARGE SPRING.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE ARE SOME KEYS ON THE GROUND HERE.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE IS A SHINY BRASS LAMP NEARBY.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE IS FOOD HERE.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE IS A BOTTLE OF WATER HERE.
<BLANKLINE>
>>> on
YOUR LAMP IS NOW ON.
<BLANKLINE>
>>> get(lamp)
OK
<BLANKLINE>

Now we can save this game.

>>> import io
>>> savefile = io.BytesIO()
>>> save(savefile)
GAME SAVED
<BLANKLINE>

Now, all of the tests below can begin by calling this restart() function
to place them back at the beginning of the adventure in a known state.

>>> def restart(room=None, objects=(), randoms=None):
...     global game
...     savefile.seek(0)
...     adventure.resume(savefile, quiet=True)
...     game = adventure._game
...     if room is not None:
...         goto(room)
...     room = game.loc
...     for obj in objects:
...         if not isinstance(obj, adventure.model.Object):
...             obj = game.referent(game.vocabulary[obj.word])
...         obj.drop(room)
...     message = repr(look)
...     if randoms is not None:
...         game.random = list(randoms).pop
...     return adventure.prompt.ReprString(message)

>>> def goto(room):
...     if isinstance(room, int):
...         room = game.rooms[room]
...     game.move_to(room)

>>> def quiet(*args):
...     for arg in args:
...         repr(arg)
...     return None

With those definitions complete, we can proceed with the actual tests!

If the dwarves activate when we are standing in one of their starting
rooms, then does the dwarf at our location get moved successfully to the
gold nuggets room?

>>> restart(41, randoms=[None, .9, .9, .99])
YOU ARE AT THE WEST END OF HALL OF MISTS.  A LOW WIDE CRAWL CONTINUES
WEST AND ANOTHER GOES NORTH.  TO THE SOUTH IS A LITTLE PASSAGE 6 FEET
OFF THE FLOOR.

If the pirate encounters us in the plover room or dark room, does he
leave the platinum pyramid since learning how to remove it from the room
is one of the game's puzzles?

>>> restart(100, objects=[pyramid])
YOU'RE IN A SMALL CHAMBER LIT BY AN EERIE GREEN LIGHT.  AN EXTREMELY
NARROW TUNNEL EXITS TO THE WEST.  A DARK CORRIDOR LEADS NE.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE IS AN EMERALD HERE THE SIZE OF A PLOVER'S EGG!
<BLANKLINE>
THERE IS A PLATINUM PYRAMID HERE, 8 INCHES ON A SIDE!

>>> del game.dwarves[:]
>>> game.dwarf_stage = 2
>>> game.pirate.room = game.loc
>>> look
OUT FROM THE SHADOWS BEHIND YOU POUNCES A BEARDED PIRATE!  "HAR, HAR,"
HE CHORTLES, "I'LL JUST TAKE ALL THIS BOOTY AND HIDE IT AWAY WITH ME
CHEST DEEP IN THE MAZE!"  HE SNATCHES YOUR TREASURE AND VANISHES INTO
THE GLOOM.

If we manage to collect all of the treasures before the pirate spots us,
then when we find him he goes to hide his treasure chest in the maze
without any other treasures to accompany it.

>>> quiet(restart())
>>> for t in game.treasures:
...     if t == 'chest': continue
...     t.drop(game.loc)
>>> quiet(look)
>>> game.dwarf_stage = 2
>>> game.loc = game.pirate.room = game.rooms[69]
>>> look
THERE ARE FAINT RUSTLING NOISES FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND YOU.  AS YOU
TURN TOWARD THEM, THE BEAM OF YOUR LAMP FALLS ACROSS A BEARDED PIRATE.
HE IS CARRYING A LARGE CHEST.  "SHIVER ME TIMBERS!" HE CRIES, "I'VE
BEEN SPOTTED!  I'D BEST HIE MESELF OFF TO THE MAZE TO HIDE ME CHEST!"
WITH THAT, HE VANISHES INTO THE GLOOM.
<BLANKLINE>
YOU ARE IN A SECRET N/S CANYON ABOVE A LARGE ROOM.
<BLANKLINE>
>>> goto(game.chest_room)

DEAD END
<BLANKLINE>

If several dwarves throw knives that hit us, does a sensible message result?

>>> quiet(restart(75, randoms=(.05,.05,.05,.05,.05,.05)))
>>> game.dwarf_stage = 3
>>> for dwarf in game.dwarves:

<BLANKLINE>
5 OF THEM THROW KNIVES AT YOU!

OH DEAR, YOU SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN YOURSELF KILLED.  I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
HELP YOU OUT, BUT I'VE NEVER REALLY DONE THIS BEFORE.  DO YOU WANT ME
TO TRY TO REINCARNATE YOU?
